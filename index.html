          /* Exercise 1: Parameters and arguments
        1. Select the #task-list ul tag and assign it a variable
        2. Create a function called cleanYourRoom with one parameter: activity
        3. Inside the function, cumulatively add activities to the innerHTML of the ul tag,
        use a template literal so you can mark-up the activity with <li> tags.
        4. Call the function and pass it a string as an argument */

        /*Exercise 2: Positional arguments
        1. Add another parameter to the function, time.
        2. To the current value of innerHTML, add:
        in ${time} minutes.
        3. What do you see on the page? It should say "undefined".
        4. Add a number for time in the function call. */






          /* Exercise 3: Function expressions
        1. Rewrite the above function as the value of a variable, just add 2 to the end of the name.
        2. Call the function and pass it the required arguments.  */






      /* Exercise 4: Arrow function syntax
        1. Rewrite the above function value using arrow => syntax, just add 3 to the end of the name.
        2. Call the function and pass it the required arguments.  */ 






          /* Exercise 5: Separation of concerns, return statements
        1. Write a function to sort clothes, give it 2 parameters: clean, dirty.
        2. Inside the function, add the clean plus dirty clothes
        3. Return the total amount of clothes
        4. Create a variable called totalClothes, give it a value of the function call sortClothes(10, 2)
        5. Call one of the cleanYourRoom functions and pass it totalClothes and a number for time.    */






    
        /* Exercise 6: The 'this' keyword, practice click event and DOM element properties
        1. Create a function called magicWand, no parameters.
        2. Inside the function write: console.log(this) 
        3. Outside the function, get the btn with querySelector and add a click event listener to it to call the function.
        4. Open your console and click on the button, what do you see?
        5. Inside the function, use the this keyword to remove() the button
        6. Use the style attribute to change the body background image.
        7. Select the div tag and change its innerHTML to an h1 with text: "Welcome to my home!". */ 







       /* Exercise 7: Hoisting
        1. take any of the function calls and move it to the top of your JS code, right under the line where you defined a variable for #task-list.  
        Does the function still run?
        */

         /* Exercise 8 - extra credit: Separation of concerns, return statements
       1. Write a function to calculate pairs of socks found, call it pairsOfSocks and give it 1 parameter: socks
       2. Inside the function create 2 variables: pairs, singles.
       3. Use the modulo % to set the value of pairs. The modulo returns the remainder of a division operation, so we can check to see if we found an odd or even number of socks by running: socks % 2 === 0. 
       4. Inside the else, calculate the number of single socks.
       5. Call the function and assign it variable.
       6. Call any of the cleanYourRoom() functions and pass it the output of pairsOfSocks.
